          description: `The Stamp Act escalated colonial discontent towards the British by directly imposing everyone\'s favorite quote: \“Taxation with representation\”.<br> 
          Passed in 1765, the Stamp Act placed a tax on a wide range of items, like printing materials, playing cards, and everything from newspapers to legal documents, by requiring a stamp.<br>
          This was the first direct tax placed on the colonists, and as such, it quickly led to a lot of outrage.<br>
          Unlike indirect taxes, which could be avoided or partially absorbed through various means, this tax was inescapable, and felt deeply personal to the colonists. Not only was this an economic burden, but a blatant infringement of their rights. The famous rallying cry “No taxation without representation” was born and united the colonists & colonies in protest. The British Parliament was making decisions that directly affected the colonists, without giving them any say in the matter. This was not taken well. It fueled the vision that the British didn’t view the colonists as equal, and instead as a lower class that could be exploited without any repercussions. If you think about this from the colonists point of view, it's like being forced to donate $1 to charity when checking out at a grocery store, instead of being guilt tripped. In response to the Stamp Act, groups like the Sons of Liberty were formed, and a widespread boycott of British goods between colonists. The explosive reaction to the Stamp Act from the Colonists showed their undying willingness to fight for liberty and freedom. And while this might have been a bit of an overreaction, it set a precedent for the British to fear, and the colonists to one up.

          name: 'The Boston Massacre',
          description: `The Boston Massacre intensified colonial unrest towards the British by displaying the violent nature of British rule in the colonies.<br> 
          On the night of March 5, 1770 a confrontation between British soldiers and colonists in Boston turned violent, resulting in the death of 5 colonists.<br> 
          This event was widely spread throughout the colonies, usually making the British soldiers seem like the aggressors, who unjustifiably shot at the colonists.<br>
          The Boston Massacre served as a symbol of British brutality, and a wake up call to colonists of the dangers of British troops in colonial cities. Accounts of the story vary between sources, but the most widely spread story at the time involved the British Soldiers starting, escalating, and ending the confrontation. Was this true? Probably not, but it fueled anti-British sentiments, helping form and set the view that the British were more a threat and than a protector. This version of the story was spread by many patriots like Pual Revere and Samuel Adams, who would go on to do other patriotic things. As the news spread about the massacre, the outcry reinforced resistance to British opposition, pushing America closer to revolution. The incident, though localized to Boston, ignited the 13 colonies, emphasizing the need for a collective act to get back at the British.

          name: 'Quartering Act',
          description: `The Quartering Act added to the growing unrest within the colonists as it was invasive and infringed on personal rights and liberties.<br> 
          The Quartering Act of 1765 required American Colonists to provide British Soldiers any accommodations and/or housing they might have needed. If barracks weren\’t available, colonists were forced to host the soldiers in private homes, inns, and vacant structures.<br>
          The Original 1765 Quartering Act didn\’t explicitly force colonists to host these soldiers in their private homes, but the updated version in 1774 (a part of the Intolerable Acts) gave the soldiers the authority to do so, if no other quarters were available.<br> The presence of British troops in colonial households was invasive and disruptive to daily life. Beyond the immediate inconvenience, it symbolized a broader overreach of British authority. Colonists saw this as a direct violation of their rights as English subjects; the English Bill of Rights in 1689 had prohibited the monarchy from housing soldiers in private homes without the homeowner's consent. By imposing such requirements without the colonists' input, Britain further alienated its subjects, fostering an environment of distrust and resentment. Moreover, the necessity to support and supply these troops also posed an economic burden on many colonists, which intensified their grievances against British rule. The act became a potent symbol of British tyranny and galvanized colonial opposition, leading them further down the path to revolution.
